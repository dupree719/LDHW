#NOTES

A class serves as a blueprint to create objects.

Objects are an instance of a class.

When creating an object in a class, must type as such: class_name var = new class_name()
and then define the object.

Variables and methods are encapsulated within the object and changing the variable in
one object does not affect variables in another.

"this" keyword = use the variables that are defined in a specific class

Objects belong in separate "tester" class from main; Main is used for testing a real class and to launch/start your Java application
Need TWO classes to create/use objects
